# eBooks-drive

This drive provides different ebooks for multiple authors.

To help with the reading of most sagas, a `README.md` will be inside the folder with the read order.

For now, the current authors I have are the following:

 - Isaac Asimov (1 book)
 - Adams Douglas (1 book)
 - Steven Erikson (6 books)
 - Dmitry Glukhovsky (3 books)
 - Marissa Meyer (1 book)
 - Patrick Rothfuss (2 books)
 - Brandon Sanderson (13 books)
